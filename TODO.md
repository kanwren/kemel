- Make splicing more efficient - `append` shouldn't be called for cases where `cons` or `list*` would suffice
  - Alternatively, remove splicing, since neither backquoting nor quoting are in the standard
- Re-implement control flow (like `tagbody`, `block`, etc.) in terms of delimited continuations
- Re-implement exceptions in terms of delimited continuations
- Tail call optimization if possible
- numbers
  - promotion rules
  - ratios, floats
  - complex numbers
- arrays, vectors
- data types:
